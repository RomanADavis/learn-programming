This repo is for programs I make as an exercise to learn various facets of
programming. I'm currently in the process of cleaning this repo up, so the
following is incomplete.

The cs50 folder covers programs and notes from following Harvard's cs50 class.

The learn-ruby-the-hard-way folder follows Zed Shaw's book, available for free
online [here](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/).

The odin-project follows The Odin Project, a project that attempts to assemble
free online resources into a usable web development curriculum. You can see it
and follow it yourself [here](http://www.theodinproject.com). The Odin Project
itself has several chapters and covers a variety of programming languages. I
will do my best to include the sources for those chapters as I clean up this
repo.

The YDKJS folder follows the You Don't Know JS series of books on having a
deeper understanding of the JavaScript programming language. You can read the
book yourself [here](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS).
