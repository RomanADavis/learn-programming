  The Gothons of Planet Percal #25 have invaded your ship and destroyed your
  entire crew. You are the last surviving member and your last mission is to
  get the nuetron destruct bomb from the Weapons Armory, put it in the bridge,
  and blow the ship up after getting into an escape pod.

  You're running down the Central Corridor to the Weapons Armory when a Gothon
  jumps out, red scaly skin, dark grimy teeth, and evil clown costume flowing
  around his hate filled body. He's blocking the door to the Armory and about to
  pull out a weapon to blast you.
