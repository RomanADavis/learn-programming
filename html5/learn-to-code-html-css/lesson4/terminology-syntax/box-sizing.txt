## Box-Sizing
The normal box model called content-box, is not necessarily the right tool for
the job. We can change how the box model itself works with the box-sizing
property.

div {
  box-sizing: content-box;
}

To support older browser, you may want to use the vendor prefixes.
div {
  -moz-box-sizing: content-box;
  -webkit-box-sizing: content-box;
  -ms-box-sizing: content-box;
}

## Padding Box
One alternative is padding box, which includes padding in the width and height
calculations.

## Border Box
Includes borders in height and width calculations. Is probably the best to use.
