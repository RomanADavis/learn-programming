Those thingies that start with the diamond brackets. When they come in pairs,
they surround an element.

Opening tags are just a name surrounded by daimond brackets. <div>

While closing tags have a forward slash before the name. </div>

The words in between are the content of the element.

Attributes provide additional information about an element.

The most common attributes are id, class, src, href.

id identifies an element.

class classifies an element.

src specifies the location of source code.

Elements with tags with attributes have the following syntax.

An example with the anchor tag would be

<a href="http://goole.com">Let's go look something up.</a>
