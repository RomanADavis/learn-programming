## Typeface
The artistic impression of how text looks, feels, and reads.

## Font
A font is a file containing a typeface.

## Color
Sets the color of the text.

body {
  color: #555;
}

## Font family
Pick the typeface. In case the typeface can not be used for some reason (for
example, because it's not installed on the user's computer), then font-family
can take multiple typefaces and attempts to apply them from left to right until
one works.

body {
  font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif
}

## Font size
Sets the size of the text.

body {
 font-size: 14px;
}

# Font style
Mostly determines rather text is in italics or not.

.special {
  font-style: italic;
}

# Font variant
Mostly determines rather a text uses small caps or not.

.firm {
  font-variant: small-caps;
}

# Font-weight
Determines rather text is bold or not. Can be given a numeric value to be made
more or less bold.

.daring {
  font-weight: 600;
}

# Line height
Sets the distance between lines of text. Is sometimes used as a way to center
single lines of text by setting an elements height and line height to the same
value.

.btn {
  height: 22px;
  line-height: 22px;
}

# Shorthand HTML Properties
Font properties are in order and optional except for font-size and font-family.

body {
  font: italc small-caps bold 14px/22px Helvetic, Arial, sans-serrif;
}

# Pseudo classes
after a selector we can some times add :keyword to change the style selector.
So, a:hover will select the style of links that are being hovered over.
