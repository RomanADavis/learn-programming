# So, how well do I remember this?
# #: octothorps or hash symbols make comments
# $: dollar sign come before certain variable names. I think that makes them
#global?
# def: defines methods/ functions
# end: ends functions and blocks
# (: open parenthesis open up the list of arguments / parameters
# ,: comma seperates items in lists, including parameters
# *: splat operator treats arguments as a list, also the * method multiplies
#things
# ): ends a list of arguments
# +: plus sign is used for add and concat methods, adding numbers and fusing
# -: subtracts numbers, also can be used to take items out of a list and other
#cool things. (Almost forgot negative numbers)
# /: divides numbers
# %: modulo or modulus return the remainder after division
#strings, and probably a few ther things.
# open: is apparently a Kernal method to open Files and not File method
# close: closes Files
# print: prints strings
# puts: prints strings with a new line.
# \: backslash that makes escape characters
# "#{example}": interpolates a variable into a string. Handy and readable.
# =: equal or gets sets the value of a variable
# <: less than returns true if x is less than y if used x < y; false otherwise
# >: greater than returns true if x > y; false otherwise. You get the drill.
# <=: less than or equal return true x <= y
# ==: equals returns true if x == y
# .: dot calls methods on objects or classes, e.g. Class.method or
#object.method, also acts a decimal point.
# +=: sets x to y higher than x in x += y
# -=: sets x to y less than x in x -= y
# *=: sets x to y times x in x *= y
# /=: sets x to x divided by y in x /= y
# %=: sets x to the remainder of x divided by y in x %= y
# ': opens and closes strngs
# ": opens and closes strings; allows use of #{} for interpolation
# """: opens and closes string; allows interpolation; can be used over multiple
#lines
# read: returns the contents of a text file as a string
# write: writes the contents of a string to a File
# exists?: returns true if a file with the name of a string exists in the same
#directory
# 'r': given as the second argument for open, opens in read mode
# 'w': opens in write mode
# 'a': append mode
# 'a+': append mode with some more functionality
# 'w+': write mode with some more functionality
# 'r+': read mode with some more functionality
# return: ends computation inside a method and returns a string
# _: underscore can be treated as a blank space in a variable name, a comma in a
#long number, a name in an unused temporary variable, and can come before the
#names of a few very touchy variables.
#
# Totally forgot formatting strings!
# %{}: acts as a variable inside of a string, so that you can treat strings as
#these weird sort of functions. "%{a}" % {a: "Tarzan"} -> "Tarzan"
# "%{first} %{last}" %{first: "Roman", last:"Davis"} -> "Roman Davis"
# %q{text}: Acts like """
# gets: waits for user input until the user presses enter
# chomp: chomps off a trailing newline
# to_f: converts to a float
# to_i: converts to an integer
# ARGV: returns arguments passed in when the program is started as a list of
# strings
# first: returns the first item of a list
# $stdin: 'standard input'; object that holds some methods for getting user
#input
# |: pipe goes around a temporary variable
# truncate: turns the contents of a text file into an empty string
# seek: moves the area from which a program is moving a file

# I suppose I should put in escape sequences, even though I didn't forget them.
# -_-
# \n: new line
# \t: tab
# \f: form feed
# \l: line feed
# \a: bell; makes a noise when it's printed
# \b: backspace
# \': single quote
# \": double quote
