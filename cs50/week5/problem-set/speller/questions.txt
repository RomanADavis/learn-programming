0.  What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?

A word designed to be long. It is supposed to "lung disease caused by 
fine ash or dust," but I don't know if anyone has ever used it that way.

1.  According to its man page, what does getrusage do?

returns the usage (Yes, I didn't find the man page very edifying.)

2.  Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type 
struct rusage?

3.  Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of 
by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?

4.  Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main 
goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that 
you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.

5.  Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one 
at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to 
read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise 
by relying on fscanf alone?

6.  Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as 
const (which means "constant")?
