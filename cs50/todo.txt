week1/credit.c works, but the code is messy and barely readable. Would like to refactor in the future.

week2/lecture_examples should have more comments
week2/ceasar works, but isn't very clever. There's probably a smarter, more efficient way to write the code.
week2/vigenere is much cleaner than caesar, but needs more comments
week2/crack not working, and not pushed to main cs50 branch. Hopefully, I can finish later.

Write comments for each assignment better explaining what their for, where their from and how they are checked.

Rewrite week3/prom-set/find/helper.c with mergesort and binary search.

Rewrite week4/resize to take a float and shrink images
