week1/credit.c works, but the code is messy and barely readable. Would like to refactor in the future.

week2/lecture_examples should have more comments
week2/ceasar works, but isn't very clever. There's probably a smarter, more efficient way to write the code.
week2/vigenere is much cleaner than caesar, but needs more comments
