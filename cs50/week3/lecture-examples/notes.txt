#+#+#+#+ Measures of Algo speed
#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#

There are 3 ways to measure the speed of an algo. Sometimes this is called the computational
complexity. I have no idea why.

The three methods are O called big O, which measures the worst case, drawn with an omega
smbol and called big omega, which measures the best case and a third method, drawn with a
theta, which applies with both are the same.

Each of these are measured by the largest order of magnitude, because that takes up the
vast majority of the steps when an algo is being applied to the largest amount of 
computational work.
