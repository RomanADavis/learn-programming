## Floats
Allow us to take an image out of the normal flow of the page and position it to
the left or right of it's parent element.

div {
  float: right;
}

## clear
Float is mostly used to allow content to wrap around content. Clear prevents
content wrapping. You can clear one side or both.

div {
  clear: left;
}
