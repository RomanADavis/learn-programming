## Absolute Lengths
####################
Give an absolute value in some unit of measurement.

## Pixel
A unit that's becoming less popular but is very reliable and easy to understand
is the pixel.

p {
  font-size: 14px;
}

## Relative measurements
#######################
A unit of measurement relative to the size of something else such as the size of
the browser window.

## Percentages
A unit based on the size of the element's parent element.

.col {
  width: 50%; // Sets the width to 50% of it's parent's.
}

## Em
Size relative to parent element's font size. So if the parent unit's font size
is 15, 5em is a font size of 70.

.banner {
  font-size: 14px;
  width: 5em; // 70px
}
