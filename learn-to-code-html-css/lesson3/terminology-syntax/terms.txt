## Cascade
#############
CSS code cascades from the top, so that the property files are applied in order
from top to bottom. If different values are applied to the same property of the
same selector, the one at the bottom is applied will override the one at the
top.

## Specificity
###############
CSS properties also take precedence based on how specific they are. More
specific means higher precedence. So, id selectors have higher precedence than
class selectors and class selectors have higher precedence than type selectors.

## Specificity Points
######################
Each of these specificities are associated with a numerical value.
id selectors have 1-0-0 specificity.
class selectors have 0-1-0 specificity.
type selectors have 0-0-1 specificity.
