The syntax of a piece of CSS, sometimes called a style:

selector {
  first-property: some-value;
  second-property: another-value;
}

# Selectors
###############
A selector tells the program where style will be applied. There are three kinds
of selectors.

type selectors - Target a type of element. For example, the p selector targets.
paragraph elements.

id selectors - Targets a particular element, designated with an id attribute.
For example, if you wanted a style for your favorite cat picture, in your CSS,
you might write

#favorite-cat {
  some-property: some-values;
}

And in your html, you might write:

<img id="favorite-cat">

class selectors - Target a class of elements. They work more or less the same as
id selectors, but are meant to work with more than element on a page. So for a
style for cat pictures, you might write:

.cat-picture {
  some-property: some-value;
}

<img class="cat-picture">

# Properties
###############
Properties designate *how* we want to change the style. So, if we wanted to
change the color of text in the paragraphs on our website, we might write:

p {
  color: some-value;
}

# Values
###############
Values let us fill in specific information. So if we want the paragraphs on our
website to have orange text, we can write:

p {
  color: orange;
}
