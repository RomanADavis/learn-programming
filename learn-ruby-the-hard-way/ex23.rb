# Started looking at some ruby code of an emulator at
# https://github.com/colby-swandale/waterfoul/blob/master/lib/waterfoul/instructions/jump.rb
# I don't understand it exactly. I mean, I get that these are methods that are
# supposed to be called if the emulator as op codes when the program is fed in a
# certain number from the rom, but there's a lot to this program. I'll have to
# come back to it later.
