// JS is a scripting language. It's not very fast,
// and if you need to build something complex or 
// math-intensive, you might be better off with
// another language.

// One of the reasons people use JS is as the glue
// holding other languages together.

// Here's the document object, which is JS way of
// interacting with the DOM, which is mostly
// written in HTML.

var el = document.getElementById( "foo" );

// But the I/O functions, like console.log and
// and alert are also written in other languages,
// although this is something you can usually
// ignore as a "system" library.
