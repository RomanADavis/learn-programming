// Statements are made of one or more expressions.
// For example:
a = b * 2;
// Contains:
2; // a literal value expression, which represents itself.
b; // a variable expression, which represents its current value.
b * 2; // an arithmatic expression, which does math.
a = b * 2; //an assignment expression,  assigns the value returned from b * 2 to a
// The way I've done them here, they could each count as expression statements or
// "statements that stand alone."

// The most common kind of statement is a "call statement" that calls some function
// and any necessary arguments. Here's an example:
alert( a );
